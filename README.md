# MoonRay for Modo: the MoonLightIPR branch

This is the development branch of [MoonRay for Modo](https://github.com/Pbaroque20/MoonRayForModo/tree/codex/native-avx-modo), where the next version's preview features are built and tried. For the plugin itself, its download and its installation, see the [main page](https://github.com/Pbaroque20/MoonRayForModo/tree/codex/native-avx-modo).

**MoonLightIPR** (it echoes DreamWorks' earlier rasterizer MoonLight) is the plugin's fast GPU preview. It shows an approximation of what MoonRay will render and follows your edits as you make them. Final renders always come from MoonRay.

The current release is 0.3.50.2. What is below is coming in 0.3.51 and is not in a release yet.

## New preview features for 0.3.51

**In the MoonLightIPR preview**

- **Hair** shaded as hair, with MoonRay's hair material.
- **Skin** with MoonRay's skin material, including light glowing through thin parts.
- **Curves** drawn as real strands, as ribbons or round tubes.
- **Fog** inside a MoonRay box or sphere, and **VDB clouds and smoke** from a file.
- **Textures on every kind of light**, not only rect lights.

**Closer to Modo**

- **Blinn and Ashikhmin materials** now match Modo's highlights.
- **The sun's disc** in a physical sky has Modo's colour and follows Disc In-Scatter.

**Working faster**

- **Assign a MoonRay material to selected polygons**, with a name, type, colour and smoothing angle.
- **Graph editor**: big graphs open on the output node and zoom freely.
- **Ramps** open in the ramp editor straight from a material's properties.
- **Light Path Expressions** has its own entry in the MoonRay menu and under Advanced in the render settings.
- **Dragging the sun or an environment light** updates the preview when you let go.

## Still rough

- Most of the new features have been measured against MoonRay but not yet used on production scenes.
- Volumes scatter light once, and a VDB volume's own glow (its emission grid) is not drawn.
- Very smooth highlights are dimmer than Modo's.
- Hair grows from curves you draw as guides; Modo's Fur material is not read.

# MoonLightIPR

This is the development branch of [MoonRay for Modo](https://github.com/Pbaroque20/MoonRayForModo/tree/codex/native-avx-modo), where the next version's preview features are built and tried. For the plugin itself, its download and its installation, see the [main page](https://github.com/Pbaroque20/MoonRayForModo/tree/codex/native-avx-modo).

**MoonLightIPR** (echoing DreamWorks' earlier rasterizer MoonLight) is the plugin's fast GPU preview. It shows an approximation of what MoonRay will render and follows your edits as you make them. Final renders always come from MoonRay.

The current release is 0.3.50.2. What is below is coming in 0.3.51 and is not in a release yet.

## Unreleased preview features for 0.3.51

**In the MoonLightIPR preview**

- **Hair** shaded as hair, with MoonRay's hair material.
- **Skin** with MoonRay's skin material, including light glowing through thin parts.
- **Curves** drawn as real strands, as ribbons or round tubes.
- **Fog** inside a MoonRay box or sphere, and **VDB clouds and smoke** from a file, with their own glow. VDB volumes can overlap.
- **Rod, barn door, cookie and VDB light filters**, on MoonRay lights and on Modo lights.
- **Textures on every kind of light**, not only rect lights.

**Closer to Modo**

- **Blinn and Ashikhmin materials** now match Modo's highlights.
- **The sun's disc** in a physical sky has Modo's colour and follows Disc In-Scatter.

**Working faster**

- **Assign a MoonRay material to selected polygons**, with a name, type, colour and smoothing angle.
- **Graph editor**: big graphs open on the output node and zoom freely.
- **Ramps** open in the ramp editor straight from a material's properties.
- **Light Path Expressions** has its own entry in the MoonRay menu and under Advanced in the render settings.
- **Dragging the sun or an environment light** updates the preview when you let go.
- **Dense hair** grows and re-renders several times faster.
- **Smoothing** follows Modo's smoothing angle, and can be changed in a MoonRay material's properties.
- **Opening a large MoonRay scene** shows how far it has come.

**More of MoonRay**

- **Bake Selected Mesh to Texture** in the MoonRay menu.
- **Deep EXR** output, saved beside the render.
- **More render settings**: volume, hair and presence bounces, a Volumes group, clamping, pixel filter and texture blur.
- **More one-click outputs**: indirect diffuse and glossy, reflections, subsurface, diffuse without shadows, albedo, motion vectors.
- **Light path presets**, and a plain message when an expression is mistyped.
- **Cast no shadow onto chosen objects**, per object, in Light Links, Emitters and Volumes.
- **OpenPBR and glTF materials** import from MaterialX files.
- **Modo's Fur material** grows fur in MoonRay and in the preview: its spacing, length, width, taper, bend and jitter are read. Curls, clumps, kink, frizz, guides and maps are not yet.

## Known issues

The ones you are most likely to meet:

- Very smooth highlights are dimmer than Modo's.
- Hair in MoonLightIPR is close to MoonRay's but not exact.
- MoonLightIPR scatters light in fog once, whatever Volume bounces is set to.
- A glowing VDB volume, or a light with a cookie filter, renders in MoonRay's slower scalar mode. The faster modes do not draw them rightly in this build.
- Tested on one machine (RTX 3090) only.

Every known issue, and what is still to implement, is in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Pbaroque20/MoonRayForModo/issues). Found something else? Please report it there.

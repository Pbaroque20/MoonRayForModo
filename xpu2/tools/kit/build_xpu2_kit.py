README = '''MoonRay for Modo {version} with XPU2

XPU2 is a renderer for MoonRay previews: MoonRay's path tracer and shader library ported to an
asynchronous design, where the processor and the graphics card each take their own work from one grid. It is not
affiliated with or endorsed by DreamWorks Animation.

It is the GPU renderer by default: System > Preferences > MoonRay > XPU2 > GPU renderer (MoonRay XPU or XPU2).
It renders the preview when the render's execution mode is XPU or Auto. Final renders, MoonRay LS and MoonLightIPR
are MoonRay's as before. XPU2 previews render the buffers the preview asks for (beauty, alpha and the AOVs) and are
denoised as MoonRay's are. Smart Render and Safe Denoising are MoonRay's: XPU2 is quick enough to need neither, and they
are greyed while it renders the preview.

First, once: Compile XPU2 Shaders on the same page (in the background; Modo stays usable, and the page shows how far
it has come and about how long is left). Until the shaders are compiled, XPU2 does not render: the preview says so.

A scene XPU2 does not render yet is rendered by MoonRay XPU instead; the Render Log says why ("MoonRay XPU2: ..."). Not
rendered yet, among others: deep output, continuing a saved render, a camera medium, normal-oriented curves, volumes bound to curves
or points, and scenes over 8 million pixels or 16 million triangles. What the graphics card's programs do not run yet
(points, geometry in motion, VDB, heterogeneous and emissive volumes) the processor renders in the same picture.

The preview shows the outlines of the work for uniform and adaptive sampling: each processor thread's 8-pixel tile,
and the grid cells the graphics card's queued work holds. With "Adaptive passes on the graphics card" on, adaptive
renders are quicker and show no outlines.

How XPU2 samples

XPU2 renders a preview in generations. Every pixel first gets a few samples, a first look. Then each generation
looks at where the picture is still noisy and sends the next samples there, and parts that are already clean stop.
Plain areas such as a wall or the sky finish quickly; hard ones such as glossy reflections, soft shadows and glass get
more. Only where the samples go changes, not how each one is worked out, so the picture settles to MoonRay's.

The settings are in Render Settings, in their own group, XPU2 Sampling:

- Generation Samples: What the render is worth, in samples a pixel on average (default: 16).
- Halting Rule: Time: stop after about the time a plain render of that many samples takes, spent where the noise is. Exact: every pixel gets exactly that many (default: Time).
- Halt at Noise: A part of the picture stops once it is this clean (lower is cleaner, and slower) (default: 10).
- First Look: Samples every pixel gets before the generations choose (default: 4).
- Most Samples: The most one pixel may get (default: 16 times the average).
- CPU Workers: The processor works beside the graphics card (default: On).
- Realtime Samples: While RT follows the scene, the share of Generation Samples it takes: lower settles sooner, noisier (default: 100%).

These settings always decide how XPU2 samples a preview. MoonRay's Sampling Mode and its adaptive settings are for
MoonRay renders: while XPU2 renders the preview they are greyed and show what XPU2 takes, and final renders use them as
always. A bake camera, or a camera with a pixel sample map, is sampled evenly with Pixel Samples, as MoonRay does.

Which devices XPU2 uses is in System > Preferences > MoonRay > XPU2 > Devices: the processor and the graphics card
together (the default), the graphics card only, or the processor only, which needs no shaders compiled.

The line under the picture says how it samples: XPU2 Gen. 16 ps avg (4-256), noise 10 is 16 samples a pixel on
average, 4 to 256 in any one pixel, each part stopping at noise 10. The MoonRay Terminal shows each generation as it
goes, with how much of the picture is still sampling.

runtime-xpu2/ is XPU2's own runtime (its preview session and the libraries it was built with); runtime/ is the
kit's, with the MoonLightIPR branch's denoiser (denoise.exe, libdenoiser.dll): Keep Fine Detail only over fur, hair and
curves, and "Denoiser cleans its guides first" in MoonRay Source Overrides.

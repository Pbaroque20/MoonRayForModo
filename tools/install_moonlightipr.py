"""Add the built MoonLightIPR GPU preview to the installed kit, with a backup of what it replaces.

Copies the session, its device program and the CUDA runtime into the kit's runtime/moonlightipr
folder, and every file of the kit in this repository that differs from the installed one: the
Python modules, the commands, the forms and the assets. Nothing is named here one by one, so a
new module is installed without being added to a list. The installed layout.cfg is edited, not
replaced, and the installed bin and runtime folders are left to the steps below. A module that
is no longer in the repository is moved into the backup. Close Modo first; a running Modo keeps
the old modules loaded and the old session open.
